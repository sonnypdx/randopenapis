* [Open Banking UK](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/) sets software standards and industry guidelines for implementing open banking APIs and applications. Relevant for UK banks.

## Banks Open APIs

Not many banks have a fully feature Open API ready yet, this list should include only PSD2 compliant APIs.

## Third Party Banking APIs

Third party APIs provides an easy way to access certain bank endpoints by reverse engineering
banking mobile application. One of the common security issue these APIs need to deal with is [certificate pinning](https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-12/Turbo/Diquet/BH_US_12_Diqut_Osborne_Mobile_Certificate_Pinning_Slides.pdf).

* [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) access to North American banks
