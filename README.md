# Random Open APIs
List of APIs that I have come across in my explorations. Collecting here so it might help others looking for open APIs while building sample applications.

## Weather

* [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) - You would need an API key and there is a free tier and go here for limits and pricing info https://openweathermap.org/price

## Videos

* [List of Videos made available by OVCAA](https://orangevalleycaa.org/api/videos) - List of free video stream by Orange Valley Community Arts Association.  Came across this while doing the course [React: Building Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](https://www.lynda.com/React-js-tutorials/React-Building-Progressive-Web-Apps-PWAs/724804-2.html) by Eve Porcello on Lynda.com
