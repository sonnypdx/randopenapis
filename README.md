# Random Open APIs
List of APIs that I have come across in my explorations. Collecting here so it might help others looking for open APIs while building sample applications.

## Weather

* [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) - You would need an API key and there is a free tier available.  Go here for limits and pricing info https://openweathermap.org/price

## Videos

* [List of Videos made available by OVCAA](https://orangevalleycaa.org/api/videos) - List of free video stream by Orange Valley Community Arts Association.  Came across this while doing the course [React: Building Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](https://www.lynda.com/React-js-tutorials/React-Building-Progressive-Web-Apps-PWAs/724804-2.html) by Eve Porcello on [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com)


## World Data

* [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) - Lots of datasets including Geospatial, Microdata (Survey) and Time Series.  Not all data is free so read the fine print before using a specific set of data. 

## Movies
* [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) - Crowd-source movie database.  You need an API key to access but it is free.

## News
* [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started) - Developer license is free.  Crowd-source movie database.  This is the API that [Server Side Rendering for React demo project](https://github.com/ilkeraltin/react-ssr-news) uses.
